# ChatBot Simple JS 

A simple and easy to build chatbot with TailwIndcss, fontawesome and vite.

# Get Started
To get started first you have to run `npm install` or `npm i` in your terminal. If you get any errors then you can try `npm i --force`
After installing the `node_modules` run `npm start` command in your terminal and see the magic.


There are some screenshots of my application.
